## 🧾 README — *The Story of the Discount Decision-Maker*

One day, while thinking about shopping online, I asked myself:

> **"Why do some discounts feel fake? Can I teach Python to only accept real, worthy discounts?"**

So, I sat down and built something smart, honest, and simple:
🎯 **The PLP Discount Calculation Function**

---

### 🏁 It Begins with a Purpose

The program opens with clarity — a clean header:

```python
PLP PYTHON DISCOUNT CALCULATION FUNCTION
```

I wanted the user to know immediately:
**This isn't just about math — it's about fairness.**

---

### 🧠 The Brain Behind It All

At the heart of the program lies a function:

```python
calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)
```

This little brain does one job, and it does it well:

* If the discount is **20% or more**, it calculates the new price like a wise shopper.
* If the discount is **less than 20%**, it politely returns the **original price**, refusing to be tricked by small savings.

Because in this app, **only meaningful discounts deserve attention**.

### 🧪 The Experiments

To prove it works, I tested it in two ways:

#### 🧷 First, with fixed numbers:

No input needed. I gave it a \$200 item with an 80% discount.
It correctly replied:

```
The price of the item is: USD 160.0
```

#### 🎤 Then, with user input:

The program humbly asked:

> “Enter the price:”

> “Enter the discount percentage:”

If the discount was too small — like 10% — the program didn’t budge.
It replied with quiet confidence:

```
The price of the item is: USD 100.0
```

### 🎯 Why I Built It

This wasn’t just an exercise in arithmetic.
It was a chance to practice:

* Writing reusable **functions**
* Using **conditional statements**
* Accepting **user input**
* And formatting output for clarity

It’s simple. It’s fair. It’s pure Python.

## ⚙️ Requirements

* Python 3.x
  No extra packages. Just logic, love, and clean code.

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Save the file as `discount_calculator.py`
2. Open a terminal or command prompt
3. Type:

```bash
python discount_calculator.py
```

Then, try different prices and discounts — see how wise your code can be!

## 💡 Final Thought

Whether you're learning how functions work, practicing input/output, or just curious how discounts behave — this project is a gentle and useful stepping stone.

> Built with Python. Backed by logic.
> **Because not all discounts are created equal.**
